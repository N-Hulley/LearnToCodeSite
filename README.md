# LearnToCodeSite

A website using React, Express an MongoDB where users are able to access and create classes related to programming. For now it will all be free to access however, users will be able to donate to the person which created the lesson (with a small percentage of the donation going into keeping the site running.)

The end goal is to have free and accessible classes for all.
